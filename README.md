Matrix operations
=================

This is a project I have to build for my programming laboratory course.

It consists in six libraries containing some matrix operations:

- Matrix sum
- Matrix difference
- Transposed matrix
- Scalar product
- Vector product

Each library will perform those operations on matrices made on different data structures:

- One index array
- Two index array
- Single pointer
- Double pointer
- Single list
- Nested lists

The program must also be able to:

- Read matrix from a txt file
- Print matrix to screen
- Save and load matrix in binary format

Each folder must contain:

- functions.c, functions.h
  (contains all functions related to the data structure)
- operations.c, operations.h
  (contains all operations on the matrices)
- main.c
  (contains main function with some tests)
- input.txt
  (contains input matrices in text format)
- output.bin
  (contains output matrices in binary format)

Please, feel free to use this code as you need. Any issue or pull request would be greatly appreciated.

I apologize for using Italian in my source code, I am asked to write file names and comments
in my mother tongue. I will translate everything as soon as I have time.
